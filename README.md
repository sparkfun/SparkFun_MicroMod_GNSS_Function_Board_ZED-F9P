The SparkFun MicroMod GNSS Function Board - ZED-F9P provides high precision GNSS capabilities for MicroMod projects using Main Board/Function Board assemblies. The ZED-F9P module from u-blox is capable of up to 10mm 3-dimensional accuracy though the module requires a clear view of the sky as well as correction data from an RTCM source to achieve this level of precision. The ZED-F9P can act as a base station as well so you can use it with a second Function Board (or another SparkFun ZED-F9P product) together to achieve millimeter positional accuracy.
